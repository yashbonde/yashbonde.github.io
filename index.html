            Hi! I am Yash Bonde and you seem to have landed on my website. I am a freelance ML engineer and
            independent researcher. After completing my undergraduate from NIT Raipur, India as B.Tech. in
            Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, I worked as an AI engineer at
            <a class="article-a" href="https://shipmnts.com/">Shipmnts</a>. I am open for work and if you
            want to collaborate connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-bonde/"
            class="article-a">LinkedIn</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a son of Computer Engineer Mother and Civil Engineer Father, and have always been passionate
            about engineering and particularly about computers. As a kid I learned programming
            with BASIC and then moving to Visual Studio Code, but there was a hault as I entered the middle
            school.
        </p>

        <p>
            The curiosity of computers remained and I pursued my goal of becoming a machine learning
            engineer, learning everything from scratch by myself. Over the years, I have worked on
            edge computer vision systems for automatic traffic anomaly and language models for FAQ
            bots, projects as part of freelancing. At Shipmnts I built novel deep learning systems for
            data extraction from business documents, improving turn around time and converting unstrctured
            business data to valuable insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            My love for science though keeps getting better of me from time to time. I believe that machine
            learning is the next wave of sensory improvements in human kind and thus can increase our
            intelligence by an order of magnitude. With this in mind I started an independent research project
            which aims to convert raw observational data to symbolic mathematical expressions using
            Neural Networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence has the capability of solving some of the most fundamental problems of
            our times and so I work tirelessly in this domain. However I face difficulties when it comes to
            compute resources and domain knowledge, for which I want to collaborate with researchers and help
            in anyway possible. After my B.Tech. I have realised that research is where my real interest lies
            and I would like to pursue that.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have also taught myself reinforcement learning and you can read my
            <a class="article-a" href="musings.html">blogs</a>. In
            <a class="article-a" href="blogs/teaching-machines-algorithms.html">this blog</a>
            I demostrate how neural networks powered software 2.0 is a superset of currect tech
            stack using a simple cellular automata.
