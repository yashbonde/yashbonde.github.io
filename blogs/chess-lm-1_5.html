        <h2>On scaling laws for Language Models</h2>

        <time datetime="23-11-2020">NOV. 23, 2020</time>

        <p>
            This is first in a series of blogs covering this project. <strong>TL;DR</strong> see this
            <a href="https://github.com/yashbonde/chess_lm" class="article-a">Github repo</a>.
            Also for all you who do not understand the Indian number system just read this
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numbering_system" class="article-a">wiki</a>.
            This is a follow up to my <a href="./chess-lm.htmlx class="article-a">previous work</a> where
            I train a language model on \(25Cr\) or \(225.1Mn\) moves and pose some questions.

            Initially this was going to be do and done kind of project but now it seems like this is going to take
            a while and if I am lucky I might just get a paper out of it. There are so many shitty papers out there
            that you can't believe something so meaningless can get a paper out. But anyways, it's them and we gotta
            do our योग. This blog is mostly a paper discussion and will be a quick one.

        <h2 id="power-laws">📶 What are power laws</h2>

        <p>
            It used to be when compute was low that simply adding more layers to a network used to work. But this
            paradigm changed with very large model (GPT-2, BERT, T5, etc.) and with the investment in these softwares
            it became important to know how these model actually scale, what matters and what not. So OpenAI did a
            research and answered those questions based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law"
            class="article-a">Power Law</a>. So we start our discussion with what is a powerlaw.
        </p>

        <p>
            Powerlaws are mathematical relationship where changing one value causes a proportional change in the outcome or
            power law is a function \(f(x)\) where the value \(y\) is proportional to some value of \(x\).
            Eg. doubling the length makes area \(4\) times and volume \(8\) times. So we can give it a form \(A(x) \propto x^k\)
            where \(k = 2\) and when considering volume \(k = 3\). Such functions have three properties:
            <li><b>Scale Invariance:</b> given a relation \(f(x) = ax^{-\alpha}\) scaling \(x\) by a factor \(c\) causes
                proportional scaling of the function itself ie. \(f(cx) = c^{-\alpha} f(x)\). Thus the log of these values
                gives a linear line.
            <li>Lack of well defined average value, which makes it hard to apply traditional statistics like mean, etc. An
                example if the <a class="article-a" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">
                Pareto Distribution</a>.
            <li>Universality, which in gist means that as a different systems behave the same way. And the exponent in such
                a distribution (\(k\)) remains the same for those different system. In the paper it means that for a lot of
                different models the scaling parameters eg. \(\alpha_N, \alpha_D\) remain the same for large number of values.

                that scaling x-axis to log gives a linear graph. Which helps when working exponentially increasing/decreasing
                values. \(y = f(x) = 5.6 x^{-0.095} \forall x \in [0,1000) \)</p>

        <h2 id="on-intelligence">📶 How to make network bigger (PROPERLY)</h2>

        <p>
            The paper we are dealing with today is called "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models"
            (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" class="article-a">ArXiv</a>) by OpenAI. With the knowledge of the power
            laws it becomes easier to predict things at scale and this is helpful as neural networks grow exponentially in size.
            But we start with defining the nomenclature:
            <li> \(L\): Cross entropy loss in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_(unit)" class ="article-a">nats</a>,
                typically it will be averaged over all the tokens in the context.
            <li> \(N\): The number of models parameters, excluding all the vocabulary and positional parameters. This can
                roughly be calculated as \(N \approx 2d_{model}n_{layer}(2 d_{attn} + d_{ff}) = 12n_{layer}d_{model}^2\)
            <li> \(D\): The dataset size in tokens
            <li> \(C\): Compute required. One forward pass takes \(C_{forward} \approx 2N + 2d_{model}n_{layer}n_{ctx}\)
                where the factor \(2\) comes from multiply-accumuate operation used in matrix multiplication. Accounting for
                the backwards pass (twice the forward pass) the total compute comes at \(C \approx 6N\) per training token.
            <li> \(B_{crit}\): The critical batch size. Training at the critical batch size provides a roughly optimize
                between time and compute efficiency.
            <li> \(C_{min}\): An estimate of the minimum amount of non-embedding compute to reach a given value of the loss
                (batch size \(\ll\) critical batch size)
            <li> \(S_{min}\): An estimate of the minimal number of training steps needed to reach a given value of the loss
                (batch size \(\ll\) critical batch size)
            <li> \(\alpha_X\): power law exponents for scaling of the loss \(L(X) \propto 1/X^{\alpha_X}\) where \(X\) can be
                any of \(N,D,C,S,B,C^{min}\)
        </p>

        <figure class="size-2">
            <img src="./images/chess-lm-4.png">
        </figure>
        <figcaption>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; text-align:centre">Parameter counts and compute (forward pass) estimates for a
                Transformer model. Sub-leading terms such as nonlinearities, biases, and layer normalization
                are omitted.</p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
            What are the lesson learnt:
            <li> Transformer performance depends very weakly on the shape parameters \(n_{layer}, n_{heads}\) and \(d_{ff}\)
                when we hold the non-embedding parameters count fixed to \(N\).
            <li> The variation in the loss with different random seeds is roughly \(0.02\), does this mean setting seeds during
                training is pretty much useless?
            <li> To avoid overfitting when training within the above threshold of convergence we require
                \(D \sim> (5 \times 10^3) N^{0.74}\)
        </p>



        <blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #ffbf00;">
            Being able to compress well is closely related to intelligence as explained below. While intelligence is a slippery
            concept, file sizes are hard numbers. Wikipedia is an extensive snapshot of Human Knowledge. If you can compress the
            first 1GB of Wikipedia better than your predecessors, your (de)compressor likely has to be smart(er). The intention of
            this prize is to encourage development of intelligent compressors/programs as a path to AGI.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The size of raw dataset is \(~1.1GB\) which is then compressed get a zipfile of \(~360MB\).
            If this is considered as baseline then our model needs to compress all this information in a smaller file size.
            However with the Neural Networks we cannot get a lossless compression, because of the probabilistic nature there has
            to be loss in the compression, and I think it is fine to do that because it compensates this by providing an inbuilt
            search engine as well. Given this set of moves we take the action that most likely leads us to win. In practice
            the baseline model with parameters given above gives a \(~24.2MB\) for pytorch model, far lower than the compressed ZIP.
            Thus making it smart(er) in a different way?
        </p>

        <p>
            On the topic of compression there are other ideas like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" class="article-a">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> (KC), the smallest
            computer program that produces a certain object as an output. For eg. consider a string like
            \(\text{0123456789012345678901234567890123456789 (36b)}\), it is far easier to write code like
            \(\text{print([i in range(10)]}\times 4)\text{ (25b)}\),
            thus we say that the KC of program is lower. Another way to look at this is as follows: 
        </p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #ffbf00;">
            Kolmogorov defined the complexity of a string \(\text{x}\) as the length of its shortest description \(\text{p}\)
            on a universal Turing machine \(\text{U(K(x))} = \min\{\text{l(p):U(p)=x}\}\)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The way to include KC in the chess problem is to say what is the shortest description of all the games that the model has seen.
            In clarity KC is a hypothetical concept and not practicaly applicable because it allows for programs that can run for infinite
            time (read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" class="article-a">Halting Problem</a>).

        </p>

        <h2 id="chess-engine">📦 What is this?</h2>

        <p>
            Current neural chess engines, specifically <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf" class="article-a"> AlphaZero</a>
            / <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265" class="article-a">MuZero</a>, primarily are search engines that travel over a
            tree to identify best bets over a certain fixed future (depth value \(k\)). It plays with itself and tries to assign
            expecation for each and every board configuration given a past. The task of neural network is now to become value
            function. However, it is super hard to code and build such system from scratch and it does not include the millions of
            games already played.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now there is a reason why you would not want to have any prior (previously played games), because this can help with
            something called <a href="https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/" class="article-a">emergent behaviour</a>. This
            emergent behaviour can help in solving problems and getting solutions that previously were not thought, from 
            AlphaGo's Move-37 to finding bug in code (driving on a box). However \(>70\%\) of the problems in this world are already
            very efficient and what needs to be done is speed up the process, which requires massive use of prior.
        </p>

        <p>
            Muzero and AlphaZero showed how we can utilise self play and
            <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf" class="article-a">AlphaGo</a>
            showed how we can use priors, thus this project is closer to AlphaGo than AZ. Now if there already exists AlphaGo (extend
            to AlphaGo for Chess) why do we even need this? All these algorithms and other supervised methods utilise board state.
            But most of the problems in this world, we may not be able to generate a perfect board state to feed into the model.
            Consider another RL problem like
            <a href="https://blog.griddynamics.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-for-supply-chain-and-price-optimization/" class="article-a">Shipping</a>
            where creating a perfect board state is impossible.
        </p>

        <figure class="size-2">
            <img src="./images/chess-lm-0.png">
        </figure>
        <figcaption>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; text-align:centre">Training method (left) and network (right) of AlphaGo. Note how is utilises
                the complete board state and internally only process it.</p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
            Now that the perfect board state is thrown out of the window, how do we train a chess engine. One interesting thing I
            have noticed in great chess players is that they have a perfect memory of board moves as if they are poems to them. See
            this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVvkz4MsKc" class="article-a">video</a> of Magnus Carlsen remembering games.
            If they can just remember things, why can we not make a neural network just remember the moves and expect that it has an
            internal representation of the model.
        </p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #ffbf00;">
            Why not make a neural network just remember the moves and expect that it has an internal representation of the model
        </blockquote>

        <h2>👾 My Solution</h2>

        <p>
            So I took the best model that has the capability of remembering things aka the legendary
            <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" class="article">transformer</a>.
            I train an transformer on moves as if it is a langauge, such that it would be able to identify patterns in it. To get the data,
            I scraped the links on <a href="https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html" class="article-a">pgnmentor.com</a>, which gave \(31,67,846\)
            games and removing the corrupted ones gives \(31,66,353\) games. Note that there can be duplicates in this and I have not
            checked for those. All these games give an approximate \(18.6 L\) or \(186 Mn\) moves. This means that model has to learn
            patterns in all these tokens.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use huggingface's amazing <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/_modules/transformers/modeling_gpt2.html" class="article-a">transformers</a>
            library, more specifically a <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf" class="article-a">GPT-2 model</a>.
            The trick was encoding all the moves, there are multilpe notations for each move like figurine ("♘f3 ♞c6") or algebric ("Nf3 Nc6").
        </p>

        <h3>🗣 Vocabulary</h3>

        <p>
            There are multiple ways to build a vocabulary. One method is to use the PGN notation, in this case we
            take all the units as "N"(knight), "R"(rook), "B"(bishop), "K"(king), "Q"(queen) and pawns are given empty
            san notation.
            <li> There can be different ways each unit moves and so we also need to identify the target box, ie.
                knight to F3 (Nf3) this gives \(6\) units and \(64\) boxes, \(6 \times 64 = 404\) tokens for moves
            <li> Include special tokens such as capture ie. Queen to E7 and captures the unit there (Qxe7).
                add equally more \(404 + 404 = 808\) tokens
            <li> Castling ie. King's side (O-O) and Queen's side (O-O-O). Add 2 more \(808 + 2 = 810\)
            <li> Then we will also need to include checks ie. Rook to A6 (Ra6+). Add all the positions and places to
                give check \(810 + 404 = 1214\)
            <li> Pawn promotions ie. Pawn at E8 moves and promotes to queen (e8=Q). Add ... see if you are still
                counting you don't get the point.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are just too many tokens to accurately find, moreover the super niche ones (like en-passant) would occur
            only a few times making distribution too skewed. One way is to simply pass it through a sentencepiece tokenizer,
            but that does not work with the interactive gaming style we need.
        </p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #ffbf00;">
            In short this is too stupid, is there a better way to do it?
        </blockquote>

        <figure class="size-2">
            <img
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/SCD_algebraic_notation.svg/1200px-SCD_algebraic_notation.svg.png">
        </figure>
        <figcaption>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; text-align:centre">The board notation is given as above, we can then
                extend it to fill all the locations in the board. You can then simply say that any move irrespective
                of the unit has a starting box and a destination box.
            </p>
        </figcaption>

        <h3>🗣 Vocabulary 2</h3>
        
        <p>
            A simpler method is to simply tag a starting box and a destination box ie. if a unit moves from A1 to A2 we
            denote the move as A1A2 and so now all we need to know is all the possible moves on a board. It turns out that
            the total possible moves on a chess board is \(1792\). In this method we have to drop the unit information, which
            is fine because library like <code>chess</code> already takes moves as <code>(from_box,to_box)</code>. Again
            continuing my assumption that model would be able to have an internal representation of the board and units and
            movements. For eg find the list <a href="https://github.com/yashbonde/chess_lm/blob/master/m2id.json" class="article-a">here</a>:
            <li>"f5d7" becomes ID \(1288\)</li>
            <li>"d5c5" becomes ID \(787\)</li>
        </p>

        <figcaption>
            <p style="font-size:0.9rem; text-align:centre"> Sample sequences shuffled. Note \(0\) means new game just like GPT-2
                and not use any special attention matrices. In my experience it does not work well.</p>
        </figcaption>

        <h2>🤸🏻‍♂️ Training</h2>

        <p>
            The training is super straightforward, we continue with the GPT-2 training style and assume that the input is
            a very long string and at the start of each game we add a <code>[GAME]</code> token which acts like a delimiter.
            For more details read the code on <a href="https://github.com/yashbonde/chess_lm" class="article-a">Github repo</a>.
            The model has the following properties <code>{"n_embd": 128, "n_head": 8, "n_inner": None, "n_layer": 30, "n_positions": 60,
            "beta1": 0.9, "beta2": 0.95, "lr": 0.0001}</code>. Training is performed on two 1080Ti with combined GPU memory of
            \(~22GB\).
        </p>

        <p>
            Since initially developement was done on my laptop I added an <code>IterableDataset</code> and for shuffling added a
            buffer. Once this buffer was full we split the tokens into sequences, shuffle them and yield those. Next task is to
            convert this to a conventional <code>Dataset</code> and see how better the results get.

        <h2>🎛 Experiment</h2>

        <p>
            First task is to see if a model can actually learn and it turns out it eventually does. Following are the lessons learned:
            <li>A larger embedding dimension does not actually help, this somehow validates what DeepMind found in the AlphaZero Paper.
                One part is the loss, which reduces faster when you have a large model but training for longer period gives the same
                loss. <b>And another part is accuracy, I still need to check this.</b></li>
            <li>The larger the buffer the better the training, by better I mean smoother loss curves. This happens because during dump
                creation the games are added sequentially and so some games might be more complicated and thus give a higher loss.
                Buffer size can help mitigate that.
            </li>

            <p  style="font-size: 0.9rem; text-align: centre">Tensorboard for training 3 models. Grey
                represents buffer size of \(55555\), red is larger model \(~3\times\) parameters of baseline parameters
                and buffer size of \(1000000\). Orange represents fully loaded dataset same arch. as Grey. Though the larger
                model trains quicker the loss function is rougher and there is a slight benefit. Grey was trained for
                3 epochs whereas others were trained for 1 epoch. (there was as bug in IterableDataset which caused number
                of samples to be lower than fully loaded)

        <h3>Validatation</h3>

        <p>
            The first part of validation is to include a tournament system to calculate the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" class="article-a">ELO ratings</a>. For this
            I have written a single script that takes two models and competes them against each other. For a larger
            tournament system will need to write a bash script that manages this script 😂. This is still Todo.
        </p>

        <h2>➡️ What Next?</h2>
        <p>
            First step is to evaluate the models using accuracy and other through competition. This part is much slower and
            will take 3-4 days to complete in automated testing. In another method I will create the large model with atleast
            \(~10\times\) more parameters (\(~1/2\) the size of GPT-2) and see how it performs (training will take
            another 1 day).

            I need help with writing automated tests. You can raise a PR on <a href="https://github.com/yashbonde/chess_lm"
            class="article-a">repo</a>, there is also a Todo list on things that need to be completed. Again a plug, I am
            currently looking for freelancing work and if you have something connect with me on my
